# Chameleon-lizard's pywal and wpgtk based autorice

Hiya! This script automatically rices your system. It uses pictures from your ~/Pictures/Wallpapers
folder and generates GTK and terminal colorschemes based on their colors. If you want to use your own 
wallpapers - just put them into the folder.

## Keybindings

They are almost default, but I have added some new.
- Super+D is rofi
- Super+Shift+Z is generating a random colorscheme based on your wallpaper
- Super+Shift+T is reopening Telegram (it needs to be reloaded for the theme to change, also you have to manually change wallpapers)
- Super+Enter is xfce4-terminal
- Prtscr is screenshot of entire screen that is put into ~/Pictures/Screenshots and into your clipboard
- Shift+Prtscr is the same of above, but for a rectangular area
- Super+L is locking the screen using i3lock

## Software used
- Zathura as PDF viewer
- xfce4-terminal as main terminal
- ranger as a cli file manager
- Nautilus as a gui file manager
- gnome-terminal as a terminal for Nautilus's open directory in terminal. If only I could use xfce4-terminal for everything!
- feh as picture viewer
- neofetch for fancy terminal screenshots
- my custom set of scripts for many things
- polybar
- i3wm, obviously
- vim with YCM and couple of other plugins
- compton as a composite manager
- i3lock-color (the only thing that is being installed using manjaro's pamac)
- thefuck as a helper if you have a habit of writing pyhton instead of python
